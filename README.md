# The Structure And Interpretation Of Computer Programs Study Plan

## Why

SICP is a classic text in computer science.

Here's what some people had to say about it.

Paul Graham: https://www.amazon.com/review/R3G05B1TQ5XGZP/

I'm taking the course by Brian Harvey and reading the book described as here: https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming

## Development Environment
I'm using DrRacket with the `simply-scheme` package as recommended by Professor Harvey and it's working perfectly.

Hi, that's me in the videos.

You can find the lecture notes, sample exams with solutions, homework solutions, and other course documents here:

About the software: Your best bet these days might be to use the simply-scheme package in Racket as another commenter suggests below. STk still works for me, but I'm only on MacOS 10.13; I know everything will break if I ever have to replace my Mac with a new one.

I'm refraining from rating my own lectures...
